sudoku
======

Sudoku Solver that apply rules to achieve results.

There are several strategies to "clean" and eventually
remove possibilities from fields. This piece of software
was made to simulate the thoughts I use while I am doing
sudokus, and can still be improved cause there are sudokus
which can't be completely solved without brutal force
(although this program can solve a huge amount of sudokus
just using strategies).

To run it just type 
	java -jar sudoku.jar
sudoku.jar file is in the lib directory
